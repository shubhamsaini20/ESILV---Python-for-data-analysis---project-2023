# Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention ðŸ›’

Data Description :
This dataset is made up of various feature vectors from 12,330 sessions. Details of this dataset: To
avoid any tendency to a particular campaign, special day, user profile, or time, it was created so that each session would belong to a different user throughout the course of a year. 
84,5% of the 12 330 sessions in the dataset were negative class samples that did not result in shopping, while the remaining were positive class samples that did.
Project Objective : ðŸ¥…
The main objective of this project is to analyze the dataset, visualize it using various libraries (such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh), 
and model it to create a machine learning classification system that can predict an online shopper's intention (to buy or not to buy), based on the values of the given features, 
using libraries like Scikit-Learn through the use of multiple algorithms and comparing between them. The model will then be converted into a Django API so that it may be appropriately shown through it.
